# Plugin_VariableSizedInteger

An [0xED](http://www.suavetech.com/0xed/0xed.html) plugin for viewing and editing
variable-sized formatted integers inside of the [0xED Hex Editor](http://www.suavetech.com/0xed/0xed.html).

Variable-sized formatted integers are desribed in detail in [RFC 3284](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3284#section-2).
The need for this plugin arose while attempting to troubleshoot issues with delta files created using
[open-vcdiff](https://code.google.com/p/open-vcdiff/).
